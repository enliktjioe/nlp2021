        "Text preprocessing is, probably, one of the least pleasant yet one of the most important steps of a natural language processing (NLP) pipelines. This step determines how your NLP algorithms are going to see the data. If your preprocessing breaks, the whole model can break or, what is even worse, keep silent and give incorrect results.\n",
